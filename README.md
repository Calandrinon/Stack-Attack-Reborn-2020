## Stack Attack Reborn 2020
A C++ version of the old discontinued clone Stack Attack Reborn.
This is a clone of the old Siemens A50 game Stack Attack.

The first time I've attempted to do this was back in 2017, when I had no idea what threads were really used for.
I finally decided to rewrite the whole thing in C++.
